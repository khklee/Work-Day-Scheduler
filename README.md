<h3>Website Description</h3>
    <p>Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. It presents time blocks for standard business hours and each time block is color-coded to indicate wheter it is in the past, presetn, or future. When a user saves events, they are saved in local storage and even when a user refresh the page, the saved evenets still persist.</p>
